         Black bean pasta is made from just black bean flour, and offers 14
         grams of protein, a whopping 15 grams of fiber, and 35 grams of carbs
         per 200-calorie serving, says Wright. Like edamame noodles, black bean
         pasta is higher in calories but those calories are more balanced with
         protein and fiber than plain old pasta. While the pasta is cooking,
         saut√© garlic, onions, some frozen corn, and spinach in a sauce pan,
         suggests Jones. Toss your veggies into the pasta and top with salsa and
         avocado.

          Oats porridge recipe with step by step pics  quick oats porridge made
          with quick-cooking oats or rolled oats. This is an easy, low-fat
          porridge made in just 6 minutes. Oats porridge is one porridge I had a
          dislike for a long time. It was one food which was given to me twice
          or thrice every day as a toddler and even later. Sometimes too much of
          anything does more harm than good. So naturally, I avoided oats in my
          life like anything.

          Halve eggs and transfer the yolks to a large bowl. Add mayonnaise,
          Dijon, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and mix to combine. Using a
          sandwich bag with the corner snipped off, pipe the mixture into the
          whites. Eggs are filled with veggies and with the filling you can
          create your own combination according to your liking.

          Paneer pizza recipe with step by step pics. This is a yum & delicious
          homemade paneer pizza made with toppings of paneer and mix veggies.
          The recipe shared shows how to make the pizza dough and then bake the

          Classic Chicken Salad This family favorite chicken salad is made with
          celery, bell pepper, green olives, apple, lettuce, and mayo plus a
          secret ingredient that makes all the difference
         </p>
         <p>
          The "secret sauce," so to speak, of this chicken salad, is the
          tablespoon of plum preserves my mom adds to the mayo-based dressing.
          You could use any berry jelly or jam, but as we always have a lot of
          plum jam on hand (thanks to several plum trees), that's what mom
          reaches for first
